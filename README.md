## How I worked on this project

The project was developed using an agile approach with sprints of 1-2 weeks.

The initial phase involved planning and design. This included:

- Creating user stories and mapping out core functionality
- Wireframing key pages and components

Once planned, development was broken into sprints:

Sprint 1:

- Setup project structure, files and configuration
- Build out forms and modals

Sprint 2:

- Add routing and navigation between pages
- Style components with Tailwind CSS

Sprint 3:

- Polish UI, fix bugs, refactor code

The general process involved rapid iteration - planning, designing, implementing features in sprints, then refactoring and improving. Tailwind CSS allowed fast iteration on UI design. Overall an agile approach helped deliver working features quickly and iteratively improve the project.

## Challenges faced and how I overcame them

Challenge #1: Integrating multiple technologies

To overcome this, I broke the project down into logical components and integrated them modularly - Next.js for frontend, Payload CMS for content, Stripe for payments. Debugged through thorough error handling and logging.

Challenge #2: Data fetching for dynamic content

Used Next.js's getStaticProps, getServerSideProps for API requests. Created custom hooks and HTTP utilities to abstract data fetching logic from components.
